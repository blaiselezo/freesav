## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `main-grid` class as the parent element for the official character sheet

### Changed

- Changed the order of edges and hindrances on the official repo
- Removed restrictions on what can be added to a race as a racial ability. Now the only thing that cannot be added is another race
- Item sheets can now scroll

### Fixed

- Fixed a small bug which would cause toughness not to be calculated correctly
- Fixed a small bug which would cause natural armor not to be calculated when no actual armor is equipped

## [v0.17.0]

### Added

- Added an option to automatically hide NPC Item Chatcards. This setting is on by default and can be found in the System Settings. You can still make a card public by right-click it and selecting the right option from the context menu
- The system now grants a Benny to all player characters when one of them is dealt a Joker. This can be turned off in the Setting Configurator
- Added the ability to automatically calculate parry. This option can be set in actor Tweaks and will default to on for all newly created actors after this point. The calculation also takes any shields which are equipped into account
- Added a new Field to the setting configurator which lets you set the name of the Skill which will be used as the base to calculate Toughness. It will default to _Fighting_. Changing this setting will require you to reload the world to have the change take effect
- Added Active Effect to the Defend status which adds +4 Parry
- Added new Status _Protection_ which adds an Active Effect that adds 0 to both toughness and armor, making it easy to apply the power. All you need to do is to put the modifier (4 or 6) into the appropriate Active Effect change.
- Added new Item type `ability`. This item type has two subtypes, `race` and `special`. If the item has the subtype `race` you can drag&drop the following items onto it to create racial abilities:

  - Skills
  - Edges
  - Hindrances
  - Ability items with the subtype `special`

  You can delete these embedded racial abilities from the race item but not edit them.

  When you have prepared the race you can then drag&drop it onto any non-vehicle actor.

  Once that is done, several things happen:

  - The racial abilities are taken from the race and added to the actor
  - Any active effects that were added to the race are copied to the actor
  - The actors race is set to the name of the race item that was dropped onto the actors
    - If one of the racial abilities is a skill and the skill is already present on the actor, the die and modifier are set to the value of the racial ability. Otherwise a new skill is created
  - The race item itself is _not_ added to the actor, it merely acts as a carrier.

- Added blank option to linked attribute selection on skills
- Added new translation keys

### Changed

- Improved permission control for the reroll options
- Newly created Scenes will now default to ther gridless option. This only applies to scenes created in the Sidebar. Scenes imported from compendiums or other sources will retain their scene config
- Set default value of Benny animation to true
- Refactored some of the new turn combat logic
- Set minimum Toughness to 1 when auto-calculating
- Changed the font size of the cards in the Combat Tracker to `20px` for easier readability
- [BREAKING] Refactored the underlying structure of the official sheet so it is easier to modify and skin
- Changed the path of the icons used to describe dice in the roll cards to be relative
- Moved running die roll to a button next to the Pace input which also displays the current running die as an image
- Changed the way the skills display on the official character sheet. They are now more in line with the rest of the sheet. Thanks a lot to Kristian Serrano for that.
- Renamed most of the tabs on the character sheet to be more in line with Savage Worlds terminology
- Actor sheets now display Active Effects which come from Items they own. Item sheets now have _all_ interactions with Active Effects removed when the item is owned by an Actor as they cannot be interacted with anyway.
- Changed the colors of active/inactve tabs on the item sheets and community sheet.

### Removed

- Consolidated the quickaccess item cards into a single file. Thanks a lot to Kristian Serrano for that.
- Removed the polish translation, as announced with v0.16.0

### Fixed

gioness if it is marked as natural armor, has at least the torso location and is equipped

- Fixed a small issue where roll shortcuts would not properly work with multiplications and divisions
- Fixed a bug which would cause preset templates to behave eratically. Many thanks go out to Moerill who was instrumental in solving this.
- Fixed a small bug which would prevent the toughness auto-calculation from taking into account AE that adjust the size of the character

## [v0.16.2]

### Added

- Added missing translations on the official sheet
- Added the ability to reroll rolls in chat by right-clicking the roll in chat and selecting the right option from the context-menu.

### Changed

- Moved the carry capacity calculation to the `Actor` class and adjusted sheet classes accordingly. This should keep it consistent between all sheets.
- Moved the DSN integration settings away from a `client` setting to a flag on the user. This will make these settings consistent across all browsers, but not all worlds.
- Moved URL for the benny image asset on the official sheet to `CONFIG.SWADE.bennies.sheetImage`
- Updated benny assets

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug which would cause chatcards to reopen again after being closed and updated from the chatlog,
- Added missing translation key for Power Trappings
- Added missing labels for major and minor hindrances on the official character sheet
- Fixed a bug which would cause NPC and Vehicle ammo tracking not to behave correctly

## [v0.16.1]

### Changed

- Updated german translation

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug which would stop the system from loading if Dice So Nice was not installed
- Fixed a spelling mistake in the english translation

## [v0.16.0]

### Added

- Added warnings to all item types which display when any action related to an Active Effect is taken on an owned Item
- Added Benny spending animation to all sheets as well as to the player view
- Added a new Configuration Submenu for _Dice So Nice!_ related settings.
- Added option to toggle whether the Benny spending animation should be played. This setting can be found in the new Dice Configuration system settings submenu and is only available if DSN is installed
- Added the ability to set a custom Wild Die color theme. This setting can be found in the new Dice Configuration system settings submenu and is only available if DSN is installed
- Added Ammo Management. Ammo management is a system option that is turned off by default. When activated it allows you to to track how many shots are expended by an attack as well as reload the gun if it's empty. When active you cannot perform an action unless you have enough ammunition in the magazine. Weapons have recieved 2 new options. One marks the weapon if it doesn't need to be reloaded, such as bows. The other is a text field that lets you enter the name of an item that is used as ammunition. There are also options to which enable the usage of ammo from the inventory. Say you have a gun which is missing 10 shots from a magazine while this feature is enabled. Reloading the weapon will pull 10 shots from the appropriate item that you set as ammunition on the weapon from the characters inventory. A warning is displayed if not enough ammunition for a full reload is available.
- Expanded Power Chat Card to now include options to directly adjust PP. This can be used to easily spend PP without having to do it via the character sheet
- Added Shaken icon
- Added Incapacitated icon
- Added additional translation options

### Changed

- Changed background color of SVG skill and `Item` to be more in line with the _Savage Worlds_ color scheme
- Increased width of Power Point input fields on the Official CHaracter sheet.
- Turned the `SwadeCombat` file into a proper class that extends `Combat`
- Skills will now always open their sheet when created on an actor, even when drag&dropped onto the sheet from somewhere.
- Generalized the operation skill dropdown on vehicles by adding the possible skills as an array to the `CONFIG.SWADE.vehicles` object
- Moved paths to Wild Card icon files to `CONFIG.SWADE.wildCardIcons` which means modules can now add their own custom wildcard icons. Testing showed the ideal place is the `setup` Hook.
- Parametrized paths to the benny textures in `CONFIG.SWADE.bennies.textures`. Can be used the same way as the wildcard icons
- Updated a few strings in the german translation

### Deprecated

### Removed

- Removed ability to interact with Active Effects on skill Items

### Fixed

## [v0.15.1]

### Added

- Added the getter `hasArcaneBackground` accessor to the `SwadeActor` class which returns a boolean
- Added SWADE-Specific status icons
- Added additional translation options

### Changed

- Changed the color scheme of the community sheets to more closely resemble the official sheet

### Fixed

- Fixed a small bug which would prevent chat cards to be posted from vehicle actors
- Fixed a small issue that would cause multiple instances of Core Skills to be created on an actor when multiple GMs are logged in

## [v0.15.0]

### Added

- Added official character sheet. For more information visit `<insert link here>`
- Added Actions to `Shield` type items
- Added ability to define skill override in an action, so the action uses an alternative skill
- Added ability to record how many shots are fired by using this action. This does nothing for now, but can be used by macros or features down the line
- Added additional translation options

### Changed

- Changed unknown driver display to black icon to differentiate from an actor that has the default icon
- Changed Roll Data (the shortcuts with the `@` notation). You can now easily access the following values:
  - all attributes of the selected token (@str, @agi, etc),
  - all skills of the selected token. Names are all lower case, spaces are replaced with dashes and all non-alphanumeric characters (everything that isn't a number or a to z) is removed. E.g. `Language (Native)` can be called with `@language-native`
  - Traits will also include their modifier shoud they have one
  - Current Wounds
  - Current Fatige

### Removed

## [v0.14.1]

### Added

- Added additional translation options

### Changed

- Changed the way dice results are displayed. The chat message now displays the rolls as following
  - If applicable, Modifiers are displayed as a list in the flavour text
  - In the middle the adjusted dice rolls, with all the modifiers already applied. Should a roll contain a natural 1 the result will be colored red so you can at a glance tell if you're dealing with snake eyes or Innocent Bystander
  - When clicking to expand the roll you can now see the unmodified dice rolls, in case you want to reference them
- Changed version compatability for Foundry VTT `0.7.7`
- Refactored the dice rolling logic to take more advantage of the Foundry VTT Dice API. This should also take care of most parsing issues for rolls triggered via the sheet and chat cards

## [v0.14]

### Added

- Added Skill and Attribute names to dice when rolling
- Added `SwadeEntityTweaks` class to game object as `game.swade.SwadeEntityTweaks`.
- Added labels to the various Sheet classes
- Added natural armor capabilities
- Added Localization for Actor and Item types (english only)
- Added `suppressChat` option to `Actor.rollSkill`, `Actor.rollAttribute` and `Item.RollDamage` options. When this option is set to true, the method returns an unroll `Roll` class instead of opening the Dialog and rolling. Example: `actor.rollSkill(randomSkillID, {suppressChat: true})`
- Added logic that will optionally adjust pace with the wounds
- Added support for active effects, including UI.
  - **Attention** Should an active effect that modifies something like parry or pace not work it may because the data is still saved as a string. To fix this first enter some bogus value into the field and then the proper base value. This will force the field to update the datatype correctly and the Active Effect should now work properly.
  - **Attention** Editing an Active Effect on an item that is owned by a character is not currently possible as it isn't directly supported in Foundry Core
- Added two new modifier fields to the data model for `character` and `npc` type actors. Both are primarily meant for active effects
  - `data.strength.encumbranceSteps` - Used for Edges which modify the strength die for the purpose of calculating encumbrance. setting this value to 1 means the strength die is considered 1 step higher for the purpose of encumbrance (up to a maximum of a d12)
  - `data.spirit.unShakeBonus` - Should be used for edges which give a bonus or penalty to the unshaking test

### Changed

- Added package name to Action deck selection
- Simplified explosion syntax from `x=` to `x`
- Refactored `getData` of all actor sheets take out duplicate or unused sections
- [POTENTIALLY BREAKING] Changed data types of input fields for attributes and derived values to `Number`. This was a necessary step in order to make Active Effects work properly.
- Changed display text of the Red and Black Joker action cards to "Red J" and "Blk J" respectively to improve readability

### Fixed

- Fixed a styling error with Item sheets

- Option to roll the Running Die. Adjust the die the Tweaks. Set a die type and a modifier as necessary. Click _Pace_ on the actor sheet to roll the running die, including dialog, or shift-click to skip the dialog. **Attention** For existing actors you may need to go into the tweaks, set the proper die and then hit _Save Changes_. Actors created after this patch will have a d6 automatically.
- Added the ability to create chat cards for edges and inventory items. (Thanks to U~Man for that)
- Added the ability to add a skill and modifiers to a weapon or power
